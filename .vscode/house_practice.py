# Test case:
# Enter your annual salary: 120000
# Enter the percent of your salary to save, as a decimal: .10
# Enter the cost of your dream home: 1000000
# Number of months: 183


# get annual income
annual_salary = int(input("Enter your annual salary:"))

# figure out how much I want to save each month
portion_saved = float(inpout("Enter the percentage of you salary to save as a decimal:"))

# annual income monthly income
monthly_salary= annual_salary / 12

# get the price of the house and the percentage for the down payment
portion_saved = float ()
# Figure out how much I'm saving each month as a percentage of my income
# each month, 
amount_saved_each_month = portion_saved * monthly_salary
total_cost = float)input("enter")
#   caclculate the interest -- current savings * rate (0.04) / 12

down_payment = total_cost + portion_saved
#     add the amount I'm saving to a running total


# Set initial information
current_saving = 0
current_month = 1
interest_rate = 0.04

# each month while our savings is < down payment
while current_saving < down_payment:

# calculate interest -- current saving * rate (0.04) / 12
    interest = curren_savings * interest_rate / 12
    # add interest to current saving
    #current_saving - current_saving + interest
    current_saving += interest #
    # add the amount I'm sacing to my current saving
# Report how many months that took


#each month (amount of savings)* rate  

# see the word each means yo have a loop
